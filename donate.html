            <h2>Donation Ideas</h2>
            <h3>Lakeshore Gatherings</h3>
            <p><strong>Anyone can sponsor a group event</strong> like bike riding, hiking, baking a cake, a magic show, movie outing, or LEGO party.</p>
            <p>If you have access to a cool workplace like an animation studio or museum, offer a private tour.</p>
            <p>Do you have VIP status anywhere that entitles you to deals? Use it to sponsor an activity at a discounted rate unavailable to the public. Be creative!</p>
            <p class="margin-b-0">Ideas from last year's auction:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A two-hour Visual Art workshop for six kids, grades K-5, led by Lakeshore parent and artist Ranu Mukherjee</li>
                <li>A private planetarium show at SFSU for a small group with Lakeshore parent and astronomer Dr. Chris McCarthy</li>
                <li>Kids Hike, Play and Picnic in the Presidio hosted by Lakeshore parent Laura Batie</li>
                <li>Private pool and BBQ party for up to 50 guests hosted by Lakeshore parent Lizzie Liu</li>
                <li>Two rounds of golf for two at the Olympic Club, sponsored by Lakeshore family, the Doyles</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="margin-t-30">Services</h3>
            <p>Everyone has a talent they can put to use for Lakeshore. Volunteer your skills for a good cause!</p>
            <p><strong>Donate babysitting, house cleaning, cooking a 3-course meal, home organization, yard work, tutoring, even pie-of-the-month!</strong> Teach someone how to sew or build a web page. The possibilities are endless.</p>
            <p>Perfect if you prefer to donate time and expertise instead of cash.</p>
            <h3 class="margin-t-30">Vacation Properties</h3>
            <p>Do you share a cabin that stays empty most of the year? Donate a weekend or two to the auction.</p>
            <p>For instance, two years ago, we had two nights at a condo in North Lake Tahoe (sleeps five) donated by Ms. Sadja.</p>
            <h3 class="margin-t-30">Gift Cards and Goods</h3>
            <p>That gift card you haven't used in three years isn't doing you any good. Drop it in the PTA inbox and let it raise money for the school.</p>
            <p>If you receive a gift over the holidays that just isn't "you," clear out that clutter! We'll take new items such as books, appliances, and unused clothes.</p>
            <h3 class="margin-t-30">Beer and Wine</h3>
            <p>A popular auction item, wine gift baskets can be made from your donations of wine. Looking to help but short on time? Scoop up a nice wine (value $20 or more) the next time you see a sale, and let us auction it for its face value for a good cause.</p>
            <p>Contact <a class="link-body" href="mailto:pta-auction@LakeshoreElementary.org">pta-auction@LakeshoreElementary.org</a> to donate wine <em>off school premises.</em></p>
