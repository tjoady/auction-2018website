                    <h2>What Can I Buy?</h2>
                    <p>You'll find a wide array of items, mostly in the form of tangible goods and certificates. All tangible goods are new, except vintage, antique, or repurposed items.</p>
                    <p>Most items are donated by businesses such as museums, restaurants, theaters, summer camps, play places, hair or nail salons, clothing stores, jewelers, spas, and more.</p>
                    <p>Other contributions, such as music instruction, art classes, vacation condos, private tours, and massages come from individuals, some within the Lakeshore community.</p>
                    <p>A selection of items are fun group experiences called "Lakeshore Gatherings," which are events sponsored by one or more Lakeshore teachers, staff, or families for one or more winning bidders.</p>
                    <p>We also feature a "Gravy Train," which is a series of delicious home-cooked meals prepared and delivered by Lakeshore families.</p>

                    <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
                    <p>There are both a silent auction and a live auction. The silent auction starts when doors open at 6:00. The live portion begins at 8:30 with Fund-a-Need and continues with auction items at 8:45.</p>
                    <h3>How do I win silent auction items?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you check in, you will be given a bidder number.</li>
                        <li>A bid sheet will be next to each item.</li>
                        <li>To bid on an item, write your bidder number next to the amount of your bid.</li>
                        <li>Check back throughout the night to see if anyone else has bid more than you. If you still want the item, write your bidder number on the next available amount.</li>
                        <li>An announcement will be made before a table closes</li>
                        <li>If your bid is the highest when the table closes, you win!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="margin-t-30">How do I know if I won a silent auction item?</h3>
                    <p>Keep track of all your bids by making a note on your program when you place a bid. Check back after a table closes to see who the winner was for your item. If you won, please pay for and claim your item at check-out time.</p>
                    <h3 class="margin-t-30">How do I win live auction items?</h3>
                    <p>Just raise your bidder number on the back of your auction program to place your bid. The auctioneer will call out bids as they are placed. A bid is registered only when recognized and called by the auctioneer. If your bid is the highest and no one else outbids you, you win!</p>
                    <h3 class="margin-t-30">What is "Fund-a-Need"?</h3>
                    <p>Fund-a-Need is a direct request for donations to support specific initiatives. <strong>This year, we are raising funds for emergency supplies.</strong> In the case of an earthquake or other severe emergency situation, schools need to be equipped to take care of our children for 72 hours. This Fund-a-Need will augment school supplies to make this possible. Without this support, disaster preparations with only district funding will take longer to complete.</p>
                    <h3 class="margin-t-30">What if I can't stay until check-out?</h3>
                    <p>Ask a friend to check out for you. Make sure to give your friend your bidder number for our check-out crew to look up the items won. Also, either make sure your friend can pay by credit card for you, or hand them a signed check made out to "Lakeshore Elementary PTA" so they can fill in the amount.</p>
