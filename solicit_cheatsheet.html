Food, drink, and music are provided by our parents and community donors. It's our largest annual fundraiser and we hope to raise $20,000, which is 20% of our annual expenses.Our school is a very diverse K-5 public school in San Francisco serving about 500 students, many from low-income families. Over 60% of our students qualify for free and reduced lunch. The programs we support are critical to enriching the educational experience of such a community.Proceeds go toward supporting enrichment programs, sponsoring community-building events, and supplementing teachers' classroom budgets for trips and supplies. We are proud to support a holistic approach to education through our enrichment programs such as Art, Motor Perception, Science in the Garden, Poetry, Native American Culture, Yoga, Capoeira, and Choral Music, which are not covered by San Francisco Unified School District. Over 80% of what we spend goes back to students and families, and the rest goes toward administration; no one is paid on the PTA. Donors will be recognized on our auction website (logo and link), Facebook event page, event brochure, bulletin boards, and flyers sent home to families. We are happy to put out any promotional materials as well.  We would be honored to receive your support this year.

Our biggest fundraiser is our Spring Auction which we hope nets $20,000. We also bring in $20,000 from PTA membership drives. Our Walk-a-thon, Read-a-thon, and raffle each bring in about $10,000. Product sales of spirit gear and other items, our Superhero Saturday carnival, Kid's Nights Out (drop off kid for 4 hours and we supervise), and third-party fundraisers (Amazon, Box Tops, Schoola clothing, etc) each bring in around $5,000 each. The remaining $10,000 comes from miscellaneous food and bake sales, matching donations, and yet smaller fundraisers.
