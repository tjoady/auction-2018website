	<p>The most direct way to help is to sponsor the auction with a cash donation. This contribution is tax-deductible and offsets auction costs, including food/beverage, dishware, decorations, materials for gift baskets, venue, insurance, liquor license, and credit card processing fees.</p>
	<p class="margin-b-0">We offer four levels of sponsorship:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Platinum ($500+)</li>
		<li>Gold ($250+)</li>
		<li>Silver ($100+)</li>
		<li>Contributor (up to $100)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Platinum, Gold, and Silver Sponsors will be listed in the event brochure and Lakeshore auction catalog. The auction catalog will link to the business website and display the business logo if one is provided one or the webmaster can find a suitable image online.</p>
